# Deltarune_CombatSystem
Recreation of the Deltarune combat system (a mix of turn-based, bullet hell and QTE systems) in Unity.

PROMPT: 
"Program a 'battle mode' very similar to Deltarune in Unity3D. Like an RPG fight/battle mini-game which is so common these days. So there would be the "fight, mercy, item and act" buttons, along with player health, player mana, sidekick health and mana, enemy health and enemy mana. Enemy fight would be randomized sequences of sprites that the player needs to dodge (think bullet hell) with turns between the player and enemy."
